- *Other resources as communicated by instructor.*

## Software and Tools

- You may use any development environment you choose, e.g., Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.  As far as computer languages, **only** C++ or Java are acceptable to do assignments. We will also learn and use UML. You are free to use any tool that facilitates generation of UML diagrams as long as you can email them to me such that I can see them (i.e., pdf or any image type). Options include commercial tools (Altova, Rational), OpenSource, Visio, ArgoUML, plantUML, etc.  It is your responsibility to experiment with these tools and pick one that suits your needs. Hand drawn UML diagrams ***will not*** be accepted.

## Grading

- Homework: 30%
- Mid Term : 35%
- Final : 35%

## Grading Policy

- **Important**: You must get at least 40/70 in your exams (combined) to pass the course. Anything less than 40 is an automatic failure, regardless of your homework score.
- The overall grade for the course will be curved if and only if you meet the 40 point minimum in your exams.
- Homework and exams will be graded on a straight scale. No curve.
- If you go to class, participate, read the assigned material, and complete your homework you should do fine in the course.
- Any cheating will be dealt with severely. You will receive an automatic `F` and dismissal from the course.  I monitor prior year’s solutions, Stack Overflow, etc.
- Use of any material that is not yours must be cited.

## Policy

- You are responsible for any announcements made in class.  These will be made either during lectures, or posted in D2L.
- **No late submissions are allowed** unless an emergency occurs. **This is strictly enforced**. D2L will not accept late assignments. **Please do not challenge this policy**.
- Academic DISHONESTY results in an **automatic F** for you and the person you copy from. This should never be a problem, however, **_every year_**, instances of cheating do occur (i.e. StackOverflow). There are web sites in the Internet that provide answers to high bidders. I do monitor these sites. If you do not know how to solve a problem, ask me!
- You are expected to attend class in-person. A lack of attendance will affect you when I curve final grades.
- Absolutely **no texting or using cell phones** in class. If you must use your mobile/cell device you must leave the classroom.
- The class will be held in-person, so you must attend. They are not recorded.
